The input files should be located in the `inputs` folder. `foamAging.json` controls aging simulation, whereas `foamConductivity.json` controls foam conductivity simulation. `init_foamConductivity.json` provides initial points for the initialization of foamConductivity.

### Preparing foamAging.json
The following key-pairs should be defined:
- `modelType`: "homogeneous" model first estimates effective foam diffusivity using analytical model, and then simulates diffusion of blowing agents through foam. "heterogeneous" model represents foam as a series of parallel polymer walls separated by gas cells and simulates diffusion of blowing agents directly in this foam. ["homogeneous","heterogeneous"]
- `numerics`:
    - `timeStart`: starting time (s)
    - `timeEnd`: end time (s)
    - `progressTime`: determines spacing between outputs ["logarithmic","linear"]
    - `numberOfOutputs`: how many times should the intermediate results be written, used for linear progress of time
    - `outputsPerOrder`: how many times we save per decade if we have logarithmic progress of time
    - `numberOfOrders`: for how many decades we save in logarithmic progress of time - used to determine total number of outputs, assumes starting time is 0 
    - `wallDiscretization`: number of finite volumes in each wall, used in heterogeneous model
    - `cellDiscretization`: number of finite volumes in each cell, used in heterogeneous model
